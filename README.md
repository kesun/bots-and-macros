# bots-and-macros
An on-going compilation of JS bots for web-based applications/games. Saves me and my fellow comrades from the need to perform dry and repetitive tasks on the browser while achieving the same goal with insane efficiency.

## Target web apps/platforms
* Ayakashi Ghost Guild (Chrome ext. version)
  * Bots for various event, battle, and story modes.
* Steam community market. [Dummy-proof generator version]("http://konishi.graphics/test/")
  * Bot for camping an item for a particular price and auto-purchase (bulk purchase option available)

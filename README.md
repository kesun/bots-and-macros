# bots-and-macros
An on-going compilation of JS bots for web-based applications/games. Saves me and my fellow comrades from the need to perform dry and repetitive tasks on the browser while achieving the same goal with insane efficiency.

## Target apps/platforms
* Grand Sphere [ACTIVE, see notes]
  * A lazy but practical MonkeyRunner script for farming
* Ayakashi Ghost Guild (Chrome ext. version) [CONTENT OBSOLETE]
  * Bots for various event, battle, and story modes.
* Steam community market. ([Dummy-proof generator version](http://konishi.graphics/test/)) [OUT OF DATE]
  * Bot for camping an item for a particular price and auto-purchase (bulk purchase option available)

## NOTE:
The bots are tailored for my own devices and needs, they will almost likely not fit your needs perfectly, hence modifications will be mandatory if you want to tailor them to suit your purposes.
